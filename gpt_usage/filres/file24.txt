LATOKEN’s mission is to put financial life at fingertips. So people can use money to build future and be stakeholders of it.



Internet transfer ideas, blockchain transfer value and ideas into life. Money is energy. Send the energy to transform any corner of the earth.



We are doing it to free people’s potential with the economic freedom to own and manage assets and money free of bureaucracy and corruption. So people can access money for their health, education, productivity, assets, and investments to become stakeholders of mankind’s future. This economic freedom can be spread with the adoption of cryptocurrency and assets worldwide.

Ideas into life

Why many great ideas never happen or barely adopted?

Ideas worth nothing, execution is the king say investors. People have to get through many hurdles to make ideas happen.

They still should heavy-lift fundraising, investing, and payments. Thus have little time and energy left for their ideas and products. As a result of the heavy pressure only 1 out of 100 000 startups get to IPO while many entrepreneurs end up homeless on San Francisco streets. They burn their scarce resources to relocate here for investments.



If you were not based near San Francisco, you had many times less chance to raise investments. “If you are far from the internet oligopolies to have lunches with their managers, how would you get acquired by them?”, “If you are not in US, how would we know that your financials would not be faked or bank account raided”, “How would customers pay you online if they do not have credit cards?” - a VC investor would wonder.



Imagine if anyone with an idea can invest or find investors or have customers everywhere the same day. We are to free peoples potential to bring next big things.



Imagine the future, where it does not matter where do you live, it does not matter if you have connections with authorities, if parents can invest into you or give technology and clients from their company. You are equally empowered to bring your idea into life. If your idea really may help other people, they will invest to make a try and what you will build will be available to everyone the same day.

Protect and transfer value

Why it takes more time to wire money abroad today than to fly to the moon and back 60 years ago?

Why do you pay 2-3% to process your transaction when you buy a coffee? Why would it cost a grocery shop profit margin to move some electrons from one data base into another?

Why in many countries a central banker or a politician may print money for her friends and steal your money with inflation (failing the inflation targeting)?



Today, the financial system is still based on heavy and costful layers of banks. Many of them leverage network effects, government relations and regulation to keep their monopoly margins. Do not take it wrong, we serve clients, not our ego to look better than older institutions. 2.5 bn people do not have any bank account, not because of bad habits of banks. The costs of local corruption, costs of clients credit risks exceed transaction revenues, making opening traditional bank offices worthless in many regions.

The freedom

Open the world for economic freedom and equal opportunity.


“Culture is not something what we have in our hearts. It is not a set of our beliefs. Culture is a set of actions. We have beliefs and Principles and we do everything to make them working. Who you are is what you do.”



We leverage shocking rules to make it clear.

For example, if one is not following the Rule to be the client of the product her is building - her would not be able to work on it.



 

We commit to follow LATOKEN Principles. If we violate any of them we report it, make our best to fix mistake and learn from the failure. We help teammates to follow the principles. If we think one is violating the principles - we will tell about it to her or speak up to her supervisor, and of cause would not talk behind the person’s back.



* Clients First, Ego Last
  * We are the users. We use the product we are building for work or personal matters as customers.
  * Align each task and second of your life with the clients success. Architect 200 tn of your synapses and  100x more of synapses around for your life mission lasting beyond your body life.
  * Feel grievance about client, not about yourself. Clients are not for serving our egos of being the rulers of the future.
  * Get shit done - do whatever is needed for the future client success, not for career or money or comfort.
* Become a Visionary Over Achiever
  * Envision the future we are building and be responsible for this future, clients, company, and teammates.
  * Shine this vision to teammates, so they see how their tasks move to the envisioned future.
  * Set priorities and hit the target in a single bullet.
  * Make OKRs, or any progress or failure clear.
  * Think big. Count in second- and third-order consequences.
  * Have your high-performance area, limit jumping around. Know who you are and what is your personal mission.
  * Have the courage to take a reasonable risk. Mistakes are ok if reported and learned. If you suffer - good, it means you are growing.
  * Comfort is death - get out of comfort. Comfort means you do not have stretched goals to grow to change the world. Do not waste life in comfort as you decided to be start-upper if you are reading it.
  * Use any second of your life for your mission of innovator. You have meaningful time with your relatives and friends helpful to achieve the mission. Isn’t it?
* Top World Talent at Every Role
  * Rase the bar with any hire. Newcomers must be better than we are today, so we become greater tomorrow.
  * Everyone is responsible for hiring. Managers are promoted based on their ability to attract and develop top talent.
  * We embrace tough love: give and get real feedback to grow.
  * We are radically conscious and make an effort to comprehend deeply counterintuitive innovations. Those who rest on astrology and metaphysics would not find comfort here.
  * Never waste time. If we go to a date, we learn or build something moving forward to our mission and are open about it. When we walk or work out we listen to audiobooks of Titans.
* Always Learn, especially From Failures, Enemies and Titans
* Mistake is ok if used for learning. Hiding mistakes is a crime. We ask for help when getting stuck or feel incompetent.
* Double effort when failed. Learning how to get out of shit is the greatest one. Get shit done.
* Discover the root problem. Ask “why did it happen 4 times to get in-depth insight what should be fixed.
* We do not defend or excuse our ego. We focus on how to get things done. And protect our assets such as clients loyalty and success, culture and processes.
* Enemies and competitors are our best friends as they force us to learn complex things.
* Find a 10x better way to do things. Leverage weekend hackathons to find a no-code tool.
* Read the Books of Titans (legendary founders and investors, not info-businessmen).
* Create Feedback Loops
  * We do calls with clients and product testing.
  * Client success managers, QA, SMM and everybody post their insights from clients.
  * We vote to express our team opinion and react on important posts in Slack.
* Be Ethically and Radically Transparent and Direct
  * Grandma should understand your OKRs, tasks, and failures at first glance.
  * Stories must be “Who needs What because Why”.
  * Give open feedback. We do not hide our opinions and never backtalk. If we suffer from our openness - this mean we are growing. If we see something unethical or if we are unhappy, it is our job to speak up.
  * Prefer productive open conflict to find a great solution over tacit compromise over mediocracy.
  * Negative feedback in public is better than no feedback. Especially if one demonstrate negligence to the principles.
  * Never do backtalk or gossip. We share with others only what we would say if the other person was in the room. If we discuss a misalignment - it should be heard by the person or her supervisors as we want to correct it. Otherwise it is likely to be collusion against a teammate, and potentially against all teammates and clients. We stop and report backtalk.
  * We ask for help when getting stuck or feel incompetent.
  * Keep confidential data under lock such as client personal data, salaries, bonuses, procedures related to security.
  * Report to supervisor and CEO if the Principles or Code of Ethics are violated or not working well
